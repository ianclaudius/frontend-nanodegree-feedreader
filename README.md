# Udacity FEND
## Project: Feed Reader Testing

### How to Run/Install
I suggest cloning/downloading the repo at [https://github.com/ianclaudius/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git](https://github.com/ianclaudius/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git) in order to run the project locally.

It is also hosted on GitHub pages, however I would avoid that approach for now as it doesn't appear to be running Jasmine successfully: [https://ianclaudius.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/index.html](https://ianclaudius.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/index.html)

### Project Overview
This project is centered around the development of a successful [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suite for an existing RSS feed application.
